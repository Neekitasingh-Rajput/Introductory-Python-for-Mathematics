# Introductory-Python-for-Mathematics 🐍
Classwork, lab exercises, and foundational practice problems from Semester 2: Introductory Python for Mathematics course at CHRIST (Deemed to be University).

-----

## Project Description

This repository contains the **Foundations Sets** and **Unit-wise Classwork** files completed for the **Introduction to Python for Mathematics** course during **Semester II** at **CHRIST (Deemed to be University)**.

The exercises focus on using Python libraries like **SymPy** for symbolic mathematics (Calculus, Algebra), **NumPy** for numerical computation (Matrices, Arrays), and **Matplotlib/Pandas** for data handling and visualization — all applied to solve mathematical problems.

## Foundations and Classwork Index

The work is organized into two primary sections: foundational concepts and unit-specific classwork.

### I. Foundations Sets (Python Pre-requisites)

These files cover fundamental Python concepts essential for the advanced mathematical computing taught in the course.

| File | Primary Topic | Key Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Foundations_Set 1.ipynb`** | Data Structures & Control Flow | Writing programs for iteration, list manipulation, and removing duplicates using `set`. |
| **`Foundations_Set 2.ipynb`** | Collections & Grouping | Advanced operations on **sets** and **tuples**, and organizing data into dictionaries (e.g., grouping by first digit). |

### II. Unit-wise Classwork

These notebooks align with the specific units of the syllabus, focusing on specialized Python libraries for mathematical applications.

| File | Primary Topic | Key Libraries Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Classwork Unit1.ipynb`** | Python Fundamentals | Variables, data types (**complex numbers**), and scope (Local vs. Global). |
| **`Classwork Unit2.ipynb`** | **SymPy** (Algebra) | Symbolic computation, equation solving, substitution, and defining mathematical **Symbols**. |
| **`Classwork Unit3.ipynb`** | **SymPy** (Calculus) | Implementing mathematical functions like **Limits**, **Derivatives**, and definite/indefinite **Integrals**. |
| **`Classwork Unit4.ipynb`** | **NumPy** (Linear Algebra) | Creating, manipulating, and performing operations (addition, multiplication, slicing) on **Matrices** and N-dimensional arrays. |
| **`Classwork Unit5.ipynb`** | **Pandas & Matplotlib** | Data visualization using **Pyplot** (bar plots, line plots) and basic data handling with **Pandas**. |
